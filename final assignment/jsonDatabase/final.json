There are however drawbacks to a world that's perhaps too realistic/ immersive. There are big open spaces that can be annoying to traverse. The cities are very similar looking which is also accurate to how must of earth is but it can also make them boring."

But the problem with that, is that it is mind numbingly boring. Seriously, I beat the campaign and liberated every location in the game, and only upgraded 2 abilities."

It's pure action and nothing else. Nothing to think about too much. Beside the massive amount of really ugly video fade-outs and the unnecessary loading times the controls could have been a little bit more intuitive."

If your a fan like myself prepare to was 8hours beating near 100% of the game feeling utterly disappointed, only one mission in the game has any impact at all...the last one. The game is good, just forgettable, repetitive and hollow, a hd tech demo."

It's most like Street Fighter 4 if I had to make a comparison. It definitely brings it's own flair and style however. Very fun unleashing massive combos. The Ultra Edition is a good value considering you get two arcade versions of the original Killer Instinct that are standalone."

Throw in the new challenge modes that are available and you have a game that has some nice alternatives to try out once you are done with the main story mode. Overall I really enjoyed this game and have had a blast playing it."

It fixed everything wrong with brawl, and added so much more to the game. The characters are amazing, and the music is endless. If you're into the competitive scene, then perhaps you should stick to Project M, or Melee, as this game is certainly a casual fighter. Nonetheless, I highly recommend picking this game up (with some Amiibos as well!) and having a blast with your friends!"

I know there's a whole bunch of crazed Melee/Project M fans lurking around saying this game is just as bad as Brawl if not more so (Brawl wasn't a bad game, by the way), and I can agree it's not the big fast competitive thing that Melee and other EVO-certified fighting games are. I can also agree that I'm disappointed there's no story mode this time, clones are still a thing (though Melee was quite frankly worse for that), and Classic Mode while given an interesting new spin isn't quite what I'd hoped for."

They've improved every part of the game, the amount of detail in each character is astonishing. The roster with almost 50 characters is the best of them and the stages are also very good. Playing for fun and at the same time with such technical precision is only possible with the Smash Bros series, and this is the best one of them."

I'm not sure where to begin, but it was a bit of a shock when i realised the original came out 10 years ago, did not think it had been that long. My experience playing it again, although enjoyable and still a brilliant game, i now come to see what some people mean when they say its one of the worst games in the series."

Now it's been 10 years, and I finally got my hands on this awesome game again. It's still the same game from 10 years ago, but with better textures, so the game looks slightly better than before. The gameplay is still the same, which is still great. Out of all the Zelda games, I think this one has the better combat system..in my opinion. If you haven't played this game, please give it a try. It's one of the most epic Zelda games."
